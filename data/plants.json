Xylem rays relatively close, 2–4 rows, containing dark brown substance. Vessels sparse, loosely arranged, oriented toward center. Pith broad, mainly parenchyma, with many anomalous vascular bundles enclosed or scattered. In anomalous bundles, cambium forms a ring with phloem centrally; mucilage canals may occur near the cambium; xylem is peripheral; rays are star-like and contain dark brown substance. Parenchyma rich in starch grains; large calcium oxalate druses present.

Outer surface reddish-brown or grayish-brown, slightly smooth and glossy. The hilum is near the slightly depressed pointed end; the dorsal ridge is light brown along one margin. In transverse section under the microscope, epidermal cells are relatively large and nearly rectangular; their walls contain mucilage and swell on contact with water, making stratification conspicuous; an outer cuticle overlies them. Hypodermis consists of 1–5 layers of parenchyma with slightly thickened walls. The fiber layer is a single row of compact fibers. The obliterated layer has indistinct cell boundaries. The pigment layer is a single layer of flattened parenchyma containing reddish-brown material. Endosperm and cotyledon cells are polygonal and contain fixed oil and starch granules, with 1–2 aleurone grains. Odor is nearly absent; in water, the seed forms mucilage.",

    "description": "This drug consists of the seeds, which are flattened ovoid, 10–18 mm long, 8–13 mm wide, and 4–7 mm thick. One end is pointed, the other is rounded and thickened, and the seed is laterally asymmetric. Near the pointed end on one side there is a short linear hilum; the rounded end bears the chalaza. The seed coat is brown and its outer surface has epidermal cells that rub off easily, giving a powdery appearance. From the chalaza, several dark brown veins extend upward. When softened in hot water, the testa and the pale translucent white endosperm peel easily from the cotyledons. There are two cotyledons, milky white and oil-rich. In transverse section under the microscope, the outer epidermal cells form a single row, among which yellow sclereids protrude. These sclereids are mostly angular or circular, large (60–90 μm in diameter), with evenly thickened walls; in lateral view they appear obtusely triangular with markedly thickened apices. Beneath is a wrinkled nutritive layer with fine small vascular bundles. The inner epidermis is one layer containing yellow material. The outer endosperm consists of several rows of degenerated parenchyma; the inner endosperm is a single row of rectangular cells containing starch granules and fixed oil. The drug is almost odorless and tastes bitter.",

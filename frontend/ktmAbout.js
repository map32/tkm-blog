        bio: [
            `Hello! My name is Hana Van, and I am a high school student with a deep passion for the intersection of medicine and technology. My focus on oncology is deeply personal, rooted in my family's history with cancer. Witnessing the profound physical and emotional challenges my loved ones faced during chemotherapy was a formative experience. It inspired me to look for different approaches to treatment—not to replace conventional methods, but to find ways to support the body's resilience and improve quality of life.`,
            `This search led me to the holistic principles of Korean Traditional Medicine (한의학), which emphasizes balance and strengthening the body to better withstand illness. I created this digital formulary as a way to bridge this ancient knowledge with the modern challenges of cancer care. My goal was to build a clean, intuitive, and informative resource for fellow students and enthusiasts interested in integrative medicine. This project involved extensive research into traditional texts and modern databases, followed by the challenge of designing and coding a user-friendly web application from the ground up.`,
            `Through this project, I have not only deepened my understanding of Korean Traditional Medicine but also solidified my programming skills. I hope to continue using technology to create meaningful tools in the healthcare space as I pursue my goal of becoming a physician specializing in oncology.`
